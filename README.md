Project 1

Local Favorite

Introduced a feature in the Myntra app where each item in the catalog is accompanied by a dynamic label called "Local Favorite". This label will act as a button that, when clicked, provides real-time information on how many users in the same locality have already bought the item.
This information will help users make informed purchasing decisions based on local popularity, promoting personal style and uniqueness in fashion choices on Myntra.By enabling users to avoid common choices in their area, this feature promotes personal style and uniqueness in fashion decisions on Myntra.
